    CSS is short for Cascading Style Sheets, and is the preferred way for setting the 
        look and feel of a website. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a markup language responsible for 
        how your web pages will look like. It controls the colors, fonts, and layouts of your website elements.
        This style sheet language also allows you to add effects or animations to your website. You can use it to 
        display some CSS animations like click button effects, spinners or loaders, and animated backgrounds. 
        Without CSS, your website will appear as a plain HTML page. 
        The cascading means that a style applied to a parent element will also apply to all children 
        elements within the parent. For example, setting the colour of body text will mean all headings 
        and paragraphs within the body will also be the same colour.

        <b>CSS - Syntax</b><br>
        A CSS comprises of style rules that are interpreted by the browser and then applied to the
         corresponding elements in your document. A style rule is made of three parts −
        <br><i>Selector</i> − A selector is an HTML tag at which a style will be applied. This could be 
        any tag like headings or table etc.
        <br><i>Property</i> − A property is a type of attribute of HTML tag. Put simply, all the HTML
         attributes are converted into CSS properties. They could be color, border etc.
        <br><i>Value</i> − Values are assigned to properties. For example, color property can have 
        value either red or #F1F1F1 etc. <br>
        You can put CSS Style Rule Syntax as follows −
            <br>
        selector { property: value }
    </p>
