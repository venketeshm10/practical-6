        JavaScript is a client-side scripting language of web developed by Netscape in 1995 with the name 
        LiveScript. JavaScript is used to build interactive websites with dynamic features and to validate 
        form data. JavaScript is high-level, dynamic and browser interpreted programming language, supported 
        by all modern web browsers. Apart from web browser, JavaScript is also used to build scalable web 
        applications using Node JS. JavaScript is also being used widely in game development and Mobile
         application development.</p>
       <p style="margin-left: 3cm; margin-right: 3cm;"> JavaScript is also known as the Programming Language of web as it is the only programming 
language for Web browsers. JavaScript is an object-based scripting language which is lightweight 
and cross-platform. The programs in this language are called scripts. They can be written right in 
a web page’s HTML and run automatically as the page loads. Scripts are provided and executed as plain text. 
They don’t need special preparation or compilation to run. The browser has an embedded engine sometimes
 called a “JavaScript virtual machine”.
